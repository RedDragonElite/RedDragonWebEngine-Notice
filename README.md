# 🐉 Red Dragon Web Engine (RDWE)

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTICE: Transition to Commercial License**

## What is RDWE?

Red Dragon Web Engine is a next-generation web development framework built from the ground up with enterprise-grade security, performance, and developer experience in mind.

### 🚀 Key Features
- **Enterprise Security**: AES-256-GCM encryption, rate limiting, comprehensive audit logging
- **Modern Architecture**: 25+ modular core classes with auto-loading
- **Built-in Analytics**: Visitor tracking and system monitoring
- **Auto-Update System**: Seamless updates without downtime
- **Multi-Language Support**: Internationalization ready
- **E-Commerce Ready**: Integrated shop system
- **Developer Friendly**: Clean APIs and extensive documentation

## 📢 Why We're Going Commercial

After **years of development** starting in 2016 (originally as MaterializeCMS), RDWE has evolved into something far beyond a simple framework. What started as a hobby project has become a **full-featured enterprise platform** with:

- 25+ specialized core modules
- Bank-level security implementations
- Professional monitoring and analytics
- Auto-updating infrastructure
- Complete e-commerce integration

### The Reality Check 💭

Like many developers, I believed in the "open source everything" philosophy. But here's the honest truth:

- **Quality takes time**: This represents thousands of hours of development
- **Security isn't free**: Enterprise-grade security requires ongoing maintenance
- **Support costs money**: Users expect documentation, bug fixes, and support
- **Family comes first**: I want to provide for my daughter without financial stress

### What This Means 🎯

**For the Community:**
- A **Community Edition** with core features will remain available
- All existing users can continue using the current version
- Documentation and tutorials will still be freely available

**For Businesses:**
- **Professional Edition** with full feature set
- Priority support and consulting
- Enterprise licensing options
- Custom development services

## 🤝 Our Commitment

This transition allows us to:
- ✅ Provide **better support** to users
- ✅ Ensure **continuous development** and security updates  
- ✅ Build a **sustainable business** around quality software
- ✅ Keep **core features accessible** to everyone

## 🔮 What's Next?

- **Q3 2025**: Community Edition release
- **Q4 2025**: Professional Edition launch
- **Ongoing**: Documentation, tutorials, and community support

## 💡 For Developers

We understand this might be disappointing for some who expected everything to remain free forever. But consider this:

**Would you work full-time for free?** Neither can we.

Quality software requires investment - in time, expertise, and resources. By supporting RDWE commercially, you're investing in:
- Faster bug fixes
- Better documentation  
- New features
- Long-term stability
- A developer who can focus on making your life easier

## 🙏 Thank You

To everyone who showed interest in the open-source version - **thank you**. Your enthusiasm validates that we're building something valuable.

The journey from hobby project to commercial product isn't easy, but it's necessary for RDWE to reach its full potential.
